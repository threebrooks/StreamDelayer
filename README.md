# Sportscast Delayer

You likely arrived at this site because you want to suggest a new internet radio to be included into the default list of Sportscast Delayer.

Here's what needs to be done:

1. The stream needs to be FREE. Links that circumvent paid content in any way or fashion is not allowed. E.g. do not provide a link to Bayern Munich's internet radio; it is paid content and thus not allowed to be linked to directly.
2. The suggested link needs to be a direct stream link, usually something ending in ".mp3", e.g. http://audio.05er.tv/05er_128.mp3. A simple test is to just paste the link into a a new browser window. If you get the really basic player inside the window with just the play button, it's correct. If it brings up any kind of content with images, text etc., it is not correct. If you don't know how to dig up a link like that, ask a technically minded friend to help.

To get this out of the way, do not just send an email saying "FC Pumpernickel has a live stream, please add". The problem is that many of those streams are only active during game time, it would require me to track down when your team plays and then try to figure out the stream at that time. That will not happen.

That said, if you have a link, send an email to doktorschrott@gmail.com, with the email title "Sportscast Delayer link suggestion". The body of the text needs to include

1) the stream link itself
2) the suggested name for the stream
3) the suggested category (e.g. Bundesliga, Premier League)

Hope you enjoy the app!
